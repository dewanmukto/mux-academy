techniques. Those sections are meant for people
who are running short of time for their final

[[[What is it?]]]

## IELTS ACADEMIC: WHAT IS IT?

This is the IELTS module you should select if you
are willing to take the IELTS exam for a study
permit or qualifications for higher studies abroad.
And that's exactly what this book is all about!
Please note, dear readers, that there aren't many
differences between the IELTS Academic and the
IELTS General Training modules. It will be explained
in the upcoming sections (so don't panic if any of
the terms are unfamiliar to you!). Just hang on tight
and relax.

I still haven't written a separate book for the
General Training (GT) module yet. Meanwhile, this
Academic module's guidance closely matches the
requirements for either modules.

## What is IELTS?

Whoa, whoa! Stop right there. Place brakes on your
cautious mind and let us start where it all began.
Take a deep breath. Imagine this is the first day
you're hearing about IELTS.

**International English Language Testing System**
Yes, that's right! The big word hovering above this
current sentence is the full form of IELTS. The so-
called exam on English proficiency is nothing but a
simple collection of words placed together to form
up a flashy acronym.

An international education organization based in
Melbourne, Australia called IDP (International
Development Program) apparently co-founded
IELTS. They are such monsters, right? Why make
such a difficult exam that pumps tension and stress
into your life?

Well, to be honest, there are a variety of English
proficiency examinations available other than
IELTS. But it turns out that IELTS is globally famous
and recognized. Especially when people score high
bands, they receive a certain degree of prestige
from their neighbours (British spelling:
"neighbours", American spelling: "neighbors"),
friends and family.

Thus, here we all are, prey to the predators of the
education systems.

And have no worries! You shall definitely become
one of those prestigious candidates with an
excellent band score on their result sheet! Trust me.
Trust yourself.

Have faith.

Now, take a sip of coffee (or tea, whichever you
prefer) as you turn to the next page. We're going to
train up like soldiers. And fight the language
problems bravely.

[[[Sections]]]

First and foremost, you should be acquainted with
the superficial layout of the IELTS exam. That is,
what are the tests and what are they based on.

IELTS has 2 modules (or 'modes'). Academic and
General Training (also known as 'GT'). Both have 4
sections comprising up the so-called IELTS exam.

The Academic module is perfect for students
seeking higher education in distant lands and the
GT one is fine-tuned for adults and people who
wish to get a spouse visa for travelling and staying
abroad.

**Section 1** is the Listening test. To be rather fair and
honest, this section is basically an opportunity to
eavesdrop on peoples' conversations, like a spy. Yes.
You can imagine that the IELTS exam requires you
to become a stealthy spy for a day!

**Section 2** is the Reading test. This is an easy and
familiar type of exam faced by everyone in their
student life. Don't be afraid of the lengthy articles!
You'll soon learn about the softer truth behind the
bars of strict guidelines.

**Section 3** is the Writing test. This part of the exam
may be kind of tedious and hard wearing for most
people. But not you. You'll be one of the people who
can bravely face it off stress-free.

**Section 4** is the Speaking test. Ironically, the easiest
section of IELTS is also the one where people lose
marks. Why? Because they were not prepared. They
were not calm or cool enough. Stress broke them
down.

Are you tensed right now? Will this same tragedy
happen to you?

Say "No" (say it!)

Say "No, I will not suffer like that."

Consider this as an oath to yourself. As you move
onto the next section.
